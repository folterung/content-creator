# AGENTS.md

This file defines the agents used in the `content-creator` pipeline. Each agent automates a distinct step in the content production process.

Commands like `!generate <date>` and `!produce <date>` **must be interpreted as execution requests**, not requests to generate or modify code.

All generated files are saved in: `projects/<date>/`

## 🎯 Command Overview

| Command          | Step-by-Step Workflow                                      | Output Files                          |
|------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| `!generate DATE` | ① `news-collector` → ② `timeline-generator`                | `news.json`, `video_timeline.json`     |

> ⚠️ **IMPORTANT:** Final video files produced during `!produce` (e.g., `.mp4`, `.webm`, etc.) must be **excluded from Git commits**. These are intended for YouTube upload only and are not tracked artifacts in version control.
